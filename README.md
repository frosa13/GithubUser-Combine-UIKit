## Exploratory App Using UIKit and Combine Framework

This app serves as an exploratory implementation to apply knowledge acquired about **reactive programming** using the **Combine framework** in Swift. It leverages UIKit for the UI layer while demonstrating various reactive programming concepts.

### Key Concepts Applied:

- **Publishers, Subscribers, Operators, and Subjects**: Understanding how they function within the Combine framework to manage data streams.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Techniques for managing data flow, events, and networking operations in an asynchronous environment.
- **Practical Scenarios**:
  - Network requests
  - REST API calls
  - Error handling and recovery
